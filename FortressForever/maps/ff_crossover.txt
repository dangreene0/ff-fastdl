CAPTURE THE FLAG

Get into the enemy base, across the lake between the bases and steal their flag! Watch out for snipers in the middle area, you could avoid them by taking the water route.
Flags are found at the bottom of the pit so you may need to fight your way out through the enemy base. Capture points are found at the top of the base, next to the pit.
