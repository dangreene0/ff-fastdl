Enter the enemy base and follow the lights to their flag.
Steal it and bring it back to your base.
Capture it either on your battlements or in your flagroom.

Each capture is worth 10 points!

The other six bags in each base are available to both teams.
Jump pads are designated by stationary arrows on the ground.
